# P3D
For the Assignment 1, we implemented ray Tracing techniques plus two acceleration structures, but as described in the report they are not ideal to render scenes with lots of randomly spread positioned objects. 

In Assignment 2, we have GLSL implementation of a Progressive Ray Tracer that allows the rendering of “embarrassingly parallel” scenes in a short time.

In Assignment 3, we have a Unity3D scene that makes use of programming shaders and visual effects, such as Bump and Environment Mapping, Lens flare, Post-processing (like bloom effect or tone mapping), particle systems (to convey smoke, fog, fire, explosion), Global Illumination effects (such as Ambient Occlusion and Lightmaps).
